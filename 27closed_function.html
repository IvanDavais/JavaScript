<!-- why use the closed function?
     Because the closed function can create an independent space, the variable, and function which defined in a closed function
     will not influence other external function with the same name. This approach effectively avoids naming conflicts.
     Besides, when importing multiple js files, using this method is more secure than other methods.


     1.These statement codes demonstrate that the execution of closed function will be not constrained by normal function.
     2.There are three ways to write a closed method.
     No.1----》(function(){})();
     N0.2----》!function(){}();
     No.3----》~function(){}();
     3.Some external js file will add ';' symbol to block off other above code. For instance:
     ;(function(){....})();
